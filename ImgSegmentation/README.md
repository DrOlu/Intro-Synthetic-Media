# Week 6 Image Segmentation
- Semantic image segmentation: assign semantic labels (e.g., person, dog, cat and so on) to every pixel in the input image
  - [DeepLab](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab)
- Semantic Image Synthesis
  - [SPADE](https://nvlabs.github.io/SPADE/)
    - SPADE - COCO
    - SPADE - Face
    - SPADE - Landscape
