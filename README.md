# Introduction to Synthetic Media

7 weeks, 2020 Spring, ITP/NYU

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

“Technology should not aim to replace the humans, rather amplify human capabilities.”
—-Douglas Engelbart

Generative machine learning models open new possibilities for creating images, videos, and text. This class explores the idea of how artists, designers and creators can use machine learning in their own design process. The goal of this class is to learn and understand some common machine learning techniques and use them to generate creative outputs.

Students will learn to use pre-trained models, and train their own models in the cloud using Runway. For each week, we will discuss the history, theory, datasets, application of the machine learning models, and build experiments based on the model. In addition to Runway, we will be using JavaScript libraries like the p5.js, ml5.js, and TensorFlow.js, and applications like Photoshop, Unity and Figma.

Prospective students are expected to have taken an ICM (Introduction to Computational Media) course, or have equivalent programming experience with Python or JavaScript.
